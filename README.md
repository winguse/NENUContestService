NENUContestService
==================

The 2012 ACM-ICPC Asia Regional Contest (Changchun Site) is holding in NENU, and me, the contest service system author, decide to public the source code of the contest service system. 

This project was used in both Changchun Site and Jinhua Site.

I was noticed that the import data from ICPC module is not working now, it was due to the data structue changed, may be you need to updathe the code yourself. I wish it will be useful for you.
